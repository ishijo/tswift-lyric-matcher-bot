I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again
You were sitting in a corner booth, and I was in the middle of the room
We were strangers on a Wednesday in a cafe

And I thought to myself, "What if I never get over you?"
What if I never get over you?
What if I never get over you?
What if I never get over you?

You said hello like a person instead of a storm
You said goodbye like a person who was just born
